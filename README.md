# ReadMe Generator

## Description

This app provides access to all the topics a README covers, with a clean formatting for ease of use, ease of peruse. If you have fundamentals of node.js already, let's take a look at some of the code (in the screenshots) a fun walkthrough (video demo) which I've placed at the end of this file.

And here, we have the main functions, putting them to work collecting info from our user prompts, passing them along to helper functions such as generateMarkdown, which then sends the data back these blocks here to send out to YOUR new Readme!
